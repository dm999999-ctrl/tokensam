/**
 * Deep Analysis Engine — deterministic synthesis layer (Phase 1 of the research-report redesign).
 *
 * findings.ts answers "what is true and evidence-supported here?" one Finding at a time. This
 * module answers the question findings.ts and narrative.ts were never built to answer: "of
 * everything that's true, what actually matters, and how much temporal/analytical weight does it
 * carry?" It sits strictly between the two: it consumes `Finding[]` and produces a structured,
 * still-prose-free `SynthesisResult` — relationships, redundancy groups, and a short list of
 * Thesis Drivers — that a later narrative layer can render into report text.
 *
 * Hard invariants (do not weaken these while extending this module):
 * - No prose. Every output here is a structured object; only IDs, enums, and numbers.
 * - No invented evidence. Every Relationship/ThesisDriver's `findingIds`/`evidenceIds` are a subset
 *   of the IDs already present on the `Finding[]` it was built from — this module only groups and
 *   scores what findings.ts already extracted and grounded.
 * - Fully deterministic. Same `Finding[]` in (same values, same order or not — see below) always
 *   produces the same `SynthesisResult` out: no `Date.now()`, no `Math.random()`, no reliance on
 *   object/array iteration order beyond what is explicitly sorted with a documented, stable
 *   tie-breaker.
 * - Findings never carry their own persistent ID (findings.ts intentionally doesn't add one — see
 *   its own module comment on staying a thin, construction-time extraction layer). This module
 *   derives a stable `findingId` from a finding's own category + type + evidence instead, which
 *   requires no change to findings.ts and is exactly as stable as the finding's own content.

 *   includes current FDV/MC and current supply-share reads, which fluctuate with price/mint
 *   events and must never be read as a trend merely because they look large.
 * - "short_term": a change measured over <=7 days (24H/7D price change; the metrics engine's own
 *   "aligned interval" divergence/percentage-point comparisons, whose actual duration is not
 *   guaranteed to be long — it can be minutes — so these are never promoted past short_term here
 *   regardless of how the underlying interval happens to be labelled).
 * - "medium_term": a ~30-day-scale comparison (30D price window; TVL/fees/revenue growth, which
 *   this engine already buckets at the "30d" magnitude-word tier in thresholds.ts).
 * - "structural": a 90-day price trend, or a risk read from ~90 days of daily closes.
 *
 * This is a relabeling of horizon information the engine already computes (thresholds.ts's

 * "never let a snapshot outrank a persistent trend" requirement): the gap between the top and
 * bottom horizon tier (8 vs 2 = 6) exceeds the gap between the top and bottom severity tier
 * (6 vs 2 = 4), so a moderate-severity structural finding (4 + 8 = 12) outranks a high-severity
 * snapshot finding (6 + 2 = 8) before persistence/corroboration are even considered.
 *
 * - magnitude: the finding's own severity (existing signal, reused as one input — never the whole
 *   score; see the module comment on materiality not being severity renamed).
 * - horizonWeight: from HORIZON_WEIGHT — how much temporal confidence the evidence supports.
 * - persistence: +3 when the same direction recurs across horizons/repeats (agreement is repeated
 *   evidence, not causal proof — never described as such downstream), -1 when horizons actively
 *   disagree (a reversal/mixed pattern), 0 for a single-horizon read.
 * - corroboration: +2 per additional distinct analytical category beyond the first backing this
 *   driver — a relationship confirmed from two angles (e.g. market performance and fundamentals)
 *   is more material than an isolated single-category read.
 * - evidenceSupport: +1 per additional supporting Finding beyond the first, capped at +3, so a
 *   relationship resting on many findings is not unboundedly inflated by count alone.
 * - dataGapPenalty: -2 with one relevant data gap nearby, -4 with two or more — confidence is
 *   reduced, never zeroed and never treated as evidence the underlying condition is negative.
