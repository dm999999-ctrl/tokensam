// Retention policy:
// - Keep granular observations for the chart-required
//   metrics only (coingecko price_usd, coingecko volume_24h_usd, defillama
//   tvl_usd -- see SERIES_RULES in src/lib/indicators/series.ts and
//   MARKET_HISTORY in src/lib/ui/profile-model.ts). Every completed UTC day is
//   represented by an arithmetic-mean aggregate before its source observations
//   are removed; the current incomplete day remains available for live snapshots.
//   Aggregate retention is metric-specific: market_cap_usd 46 days, circulating
//   supply 11 days, total/maximum supply latest day only, and other aggregates
//   up to 90 days. The live profile reads aggregates as historical indicator inputs.
// - coingecko price_usd stays fully granular through day 37, not
//   30 -- the risk profile's volatility is a rolling 7-day window of hourly
//   returns (RISK_VOLATILITY_WINDOW_DAYS in src/lib/indicators/series.ts)
//   ending at each displayed point, so a correct 30D volatility curve needs
//   hourly price data a further 7 days before the window it displays.
// - Observations and aggregates expire after their metric-specific windows;
//   non-special daily aggregates expire after 90 days. Raw provider records
//   follow the provider-record expiry function in the database.
// The database trigger trg_protect_30d_chart_observations is the final guard
// against deleting protected chart observations inside their granular window
// (30 days, or 37 for coingecko price_usd).
//
// retention_collapse_non_chart_daily_batch is NOT listed here any more: it ran through
// this route's client.rpc(...) over PostgREST, whose `authenticator` role has an ~8s
// statement_timeout (pg_roles.rolconfig) -- fine while the table was small, but by
// 2026-10-08 (647K rows) even its existence-check probe alone took ~6s under the planner
// plan Postgres was actually choosing, and the real GROUP BY/DELETE work pushed it over
// 8s on every call, so the cursor-based retry (20261007110000) never advanced: the same
// day kept getting re-probed and re-failing every ~8-12 minutes indefinitely, letting a
// full day's worth of non-chart observations accumulate ungated and pushing the database
// past the 500MB free-plan hard cap. Run directly outside PostgREST instead (pg_cron,
// 20261008000000_non_chart_collapse_pg_cron.sql), the same fix already proven for
// VACUUM FULL (20261006090000/20261007120000): a session's default statement_timeout is
// far longer, and the same query that timed out every time here completed in well under
// a second once not bound by PostgREST's connection.
