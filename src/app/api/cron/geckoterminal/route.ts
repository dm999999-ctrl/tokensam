 * Scheduled GeckoTerminal collection. Invoked by the Cloudflare Worker
 * (cloudflare/refresh-scheduler/) on every 5-minute tick — not by Vercel
 * Cron, which on the Hobby plan cannot fire more often than once a day; see
 * "Recurring scheduled collection" in docs/geckoterminal-integration.md.
 * Requires `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`, the same secret and header
 * convention as /api/cron/refresh.
 *
 * Gated behind `GECKOTERMINAL_SYNC_ENABLED=true` (unset/false: no-op, so
 * deploying this route never silently starts spending GeckoTerminal's rate
 * limit). `GECKOTERMINAL_SYNC_INTERVAL` (ms) controls the due-check —
 * default 13 min — independent of how often the caller fires, mirroring
 * the existing refresh's due-check pattern; this is what turns frequent
 * 5-minute ticks into an effective ~15-minute GeckoTerminal cadence. Each
 * invocation processes only as many tokens as fit the time budget (rotation,
 * not a full-universe sync), so the ~15-minute cadence is the collection
 * tick, not the freshness of every mapped token; see
 * docs/geckoterminal-integration.md for rotation timing.
 * `GECKOTERMINAL_BATCH_DELAY_MS` may only raise pacing above the collector's
 * own conservative floor, never lower it. `force=1` bypasses the due-check
 * for manual testing.
 *
 * GeckoTerminal is entirely independent of the main refresh: it never calls
 * CoinGecko's /onchain endpoints, never spends CoinGecko quota, and this
 * route does not touch data_refresh_runs/data_refresh_steps or any
 * CoinGecko/DeFiLlama/DEX Screener collector.
